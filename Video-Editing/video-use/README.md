# video-use

This is the content-system variant of **video-use**: conversational editing with
word timestamps supplied by the canonical **ASR Router** skill.

Drop raw footage in a folder, chat with Claude Code, get `final.mp4` back. Works for any content — talking heads, montages, tutorials, travel, interviews — without presets or menus.

Try video-use in [Browser Use Cloud](https://cloud.browser-use.com/v4?utm_campaign=video-use-use-in-cloud&utm_source=github).

## What it does

- **Cuts out filler words** (`umm`, `uh`, false starts) and dead space between takes
- **Auto color grades** every segment (warm cinematic, neutral punch, or any custom ffmpeg chain)
- **30ms audio fades** at every cut so you never hear a pop
- **Burns subtitles** in your style — 2-word UPPERCASE chunks by default, fully customizable
- **Generates animation overlays** via [HyperFrames](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes), [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/), [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), or PIL — spawned in parallel sub-agents, one per animation
- **Self-evaluates the rendered output** at every cut boundary before showing you anything
- **Persists session memory** in `project.md` so next week's session picks up where you left off

## Setup prompt

From this workspace, ask Claude Code or Codex:

```text
Read .claude/skills/video-use/install.md, connect Speech-Recognition/asr-router,
sync the three skill mirrors, and run the readiness checks. Do not replace this
workspace variant with an unmodified upstream checkout.
```

It requests word timestamps from ASR Router; provider setup lives only there.

Then point your agent at a folder of raw takes:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/videos
claude    # or codex, hermes, etc.
```

For always-on editing from your own VPS or Telegram, run the agent through [Browser Use Box](https://browser-use.com/bux). [Watch the 15-second demo](https://www.tiktok.com/@browser_use/video/7639824093721758989).

And in the session:

> edit these into a launch video

It inventories the sources, proposes a strategy, waits for your OK, then produces `edit/final.mp4` next to your sources. All outputs live in `<videos_dir>/edit/` — the skill directory stays clean.

## Manual install

If you'd rather do it by hand:

```bash
# 1. Use the workspace variant and sync agent mirrors
cd <WORKSPACE>
bash automation/scripts/sync_skills.sh

# 2. Install deps outside the synced skill tree
cd .claude/skills/video-use
UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=<HOME>/.venvs/video-use uv sync
ln -sfn <HOME>/.venvs/video-use .venv
brew install ffmpeg             # required
brew install yt-dlp             # optional, for downloading online sources

# 3. Install/configure Speech-Recognition/asr-router; provider setup lives there
```

## How it works

The LLM never watches the video. It **reads** it — through two layers that together give it everything it needs to cut with word-boundary precision.

  <img src="static/timeline-view.svg" alt="timeline_view composite — filmstrip + speaker track + waveform + word labels + silence-gap cut candidates" width="100%">
</p>

**Layer 1 — Audio transcript (always loaded).** One ASR Router request per source gives word-level timestamps. All takes pack into a compact `takes_packed.md` — the LLM's primary reading view.

```
## C0103  (duration: 43.0s, 8 phrases)
  [002.52-005.36] S0 Ninety percent of what a web agent does is completely wasted.
  [006.08-006.74] S0 We fixed this.
```

**Layer 2 — Visual composite (on demand).** `timeline_view` produces a filmstrip + waveform + word labels PNG for any time range. Called only at decision points — ambiguous pauses, retake comparisons, cut-point sanity checks.

> Naive approach: 30,000 frames × 1,500 tokens = **45M tokens of noise**.
> Video Use: **12KB text + a handful of PNGs**.

Same idea as browser-use giving an LLM a structured DOM instead of a screenshot — but for video.

## Pipeline

```
Transcribe ──> Pack ──> LLM Reasons ──> EDL ──> Render ──> Self-Eval
                                                              │
                                                              └─ issue? fix + re-render (max 3)
```

The self-eval loop runs `timeline_view` on the _rendered output_ at every cut boundary — catches visual jumps, audio pops, hidden subtitles. You see the preview only after it passes.

## Design principles

1. **Text + on-demand visuals.** No frame-dumping. The transcript is the surface.
2. **Audio is primary, visuals follow.** Cuts come from speech boundaries and silence gaps.
3. **Ask → confirm → execute → self-eval → persist.** Never touch the cut without strategy approval.
4. **Zero assumptions about content type.** Look, ask, then edit.
5. **12 hard rules, artistic freedom elsewhere.** Production-correctness is non-negotiable. Taste isn't.
