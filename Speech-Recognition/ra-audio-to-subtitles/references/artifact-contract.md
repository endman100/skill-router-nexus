# Subtitle artifact contract

## Canonical files

`captions_words.json` is a list of ASR timing units:

```json
{"text":"字","start":1.24,"end":1.36,"isGap":false}
```

Gaps of at least 0.2 seconds may be represented with `isGap: true` and empty
text.

`captions.json` is a list consumed by renderers:

```json
{"start":1.24,"end":3.68,"text":"这是一句字幕。","source":"asr-router-word-timestamps"}
```

Renderers must use `start` and `end` directly. They must not recalculate timing
from string length, scene duration, or audio segment duration.

`caption-qc.json` contains:

- `status`: `pass` or `fail`
- `timing_source`: must be `asr-router-word-timestamps`
- `alignment_coverage`: matched original-script characters divided by total
  normalized script characters
- `script_characters`, `matched_characters`, `asr_characters`
- `word_units`, `caption_count`, `overlap_count`, `errors`, `warnings`
- `max_reading_units_per_second`, `short_fragments`, `split_connectors`
- `source_media` and `asr_resource_id`

## Delivery gate

For contracts with `captions: asr-word-timestamps`, delivery fails when any
canonical file is missing, `status` is not `pass`, timing source is not the
required value, coverage is below 0.90, captions overlap, the recorded source
media no longer exists, or its duration materially differs from the final MP4.

Readability also fails when a cue is shorter than 0.5 seconds, a one-token
fragment is isolated, a discourse connector is split across two cues, or the
maximum reading speed exceeds 12 reading units/s. English product/model tokens
count as semantic units and retain meaningful internal spaces. A speed above 9
units/s is recorded as a warning for human review.

The renderer may burn captions into the MP4 or keep them as an overlay track,
but it must archive the SRT and QC JSON next to the project media.
